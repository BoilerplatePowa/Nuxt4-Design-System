  Centralized Cursor rules configuration for the Nuxt-Design-System project.  
  Defines included/excluded paths, rule priorities, and project context.  
  Ensures consistent enforcement of coding, architecture, documentation,  
  performance, and security standards across the entire codebase.
  Includes advanced features: error boundaries, monitoring, CI/CD integration,
  and automated quality gates for enterprise-grade development.
